# ArrayManip
C++ program to sort arrays of arbitrary size

## 1.1 Method
Find/develop a method to sort arrays of integers in ascending order. 
You are allowed to use standard sorting algorithms, such as Insertion Sort, Selection Sort,
Mergesort or Quick Sort.

## 1.2 Algorithm
Develop a pseudo-code algorithm for your selected method. 
Refine your pseudocode until you are confident that you can implement your algorithm in C++ .
Make sure to copy your pseudo-code as a comment in your sorting source file.

## 1.3 Application Development
Your C++ application must have the following features:

• Use at least three files: one source file for your sorting implementation, 
a header file for your any declarations for your sorting implementation and 
a separate source file containing your test main function.

• Your main function should define (at least) three arrays of size 10, 20 and 30, respectively. 
Each array should be filled with random numbers in range 0-99 (both inclusive). 
Print each array in its random state and also in the sorted state.

• Your program must define and use at least one pre-processor macro with parameter(s) 
(must be different to sample macros from the lecture).

• You must provide your own Makefile 
(this must be written by yourself - no IDE generated Makefile will be accepted). 
Your Makefile must have the following features:

– Use separate targets for compilation and linking (make sure to compile each source file individually).

– Use at least one make file variable.

– Provide a “clean” target that removes temporary files, object files and executables created by this Makefile.

– Does not use any implicit rules.

– Running make without a target should compile & link your application and also automatically execute your application.
